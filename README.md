Classic 2D game remake

Basic Requirements:


Art:


Code:


Tech:
Game has two complete levels with lose states in both and a win state in the second after completing objective. 
There is an edge collider to disable the player from exiting the game boundaries. The menu screen has a start button, exit button, 
about button and a volume warning (issues with implementing sound where the lose/win sounds were much louder than the other sounds). 
The about section of the start menu has controls, objectives and a credits section complete with a back button to return to the start 
screen to avoid dead ends. Both game over and win states have text and buttons to quit and return to start menu.

Other Game Elements:
All art/assets (besides keyboard key art assets) were created by Gracie Sanabria. All music/sounds (besides key collection sound and click 
sound for start button) were created by Melissa Jackson. All fonts from Google Fonts. (https://fonts.google.com, https://writingduels.itch.io/free-sound-effects,
